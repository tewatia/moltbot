### Tips:

```text
1. Start simple, then expand
   - Get one channel working well before adding more
   - Master the basics before diving into advanced features

2. Use different models for different tasks
   - Claude for complex reasoning
   - Sonnet for quick responses
   - Opus for creative work

3. Leverage the /compact command
   - When conversations get long, compact to save context
   - Helps with token usage too

4. Create skills for repeated tasks
   - If you do something more than twice, skill it
   - Even simple bash scripts become powerful

5. Check the doctor regularly
   - Run `clawdbot doctor` monthly
   - Catches config drift and security issues

6. Backup your config
   - Export ~/.clawdbot/clawdbot.json regularly
   - Version control your workspace
```
